## üöÄ About Me

My name is Joseph McDonough, and I'm a software engineer who is also CompTIA Security+ certified. Most of my
professional experience is developing backend services in Java as well as Python for scripting and jobs. I have a
passion for data and enjoy the process of receiving data and transforming it into something meaningful. And while it may
not always be worth it, I do enjoy automation. Spending hours to save a couple seconds and clicks is very rewarding to me.
Designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines that then require minimal effort and automated test suites with alerting
were some of my favorite professional projects.

Currently looking a Platform Engineer @ Colgate-Palmolive!

Rhythmic Radiance is a multi-lane rhythm game in development by Kuneho Studios, a games company that I started with 
some friends of mine. I serve as a lead UI/UX engineer for our development team in Unreal Engine. In designing a 
diegetic UI, I work with data tables and structs to organize and display our data. Additionally, I have designed a 
random item drop system that rewards our players with items after completing a level. Game development is not what I 
went to school for, however, I felt that learning a new game engine and programming language would help me strengthen 
my software development skills. Through all of this, I believe my biggest contribution is through our Python beatmap 
developer tool.

The crux of our game relies on beatmaps, which are the way to translate the song into notes that appear on the play 
screen for the user to strike. Think Guitar Hero and how the notes come down the screen to the user in lanes. As the 
names and methods used to display this in-engine are not required knowledge for the individual who is beatmapping a 
song, I wanted to abstract that out. The developer tool accomplishes this with a prompt-based system. I wrote a Python 
program that gives the user options that they can select to develop a valid music chart (through a JSON file) that can 
be read in Unreal Engine. The tool is a flexible program that allows users to create, read, update, and delete beatmaps 
as they so choose, without ever needing to go into Unreal Engine.

The developer tool is a living program that will be updated as the game matures. I am also looking for new ways to 
improve the user experience and allow more advanced users to perform actions more efficiently.

### üéÆ [ARI](https://github.com/jlmcdonough/SENDHELP) - a cybersecurity training escape room experience

ARI is an educational first-person puzzle escape room game designed to teach best cybersecurity practices to all 
audiences. The goal was to create an enjoyable learning experience through interactive gameplay while simultaneously 
providing a robust introductory cybersecurity education.

To complete both a software development and a cybersecurity degree at Marist, undergraduates had to complete a 
"capstone project" which was meant to encompass their previous 4 years of learning. To graduate, a double major must 
complete two capstones. I was fortunate enough that there was an opportunity that would allow me to combine and do both. 
Through ARI, I was able to be a critical contributor to both teams. As a member of the software development team, I 
learned a new programming language (C#) and a game engine (Unity). I developed many cybersecurity-centric minigames 
that would be implemented and brought ARI to life. In leading the cybersecurity team, I was responsible for the 
narrative direction and level design of the game. Being a part of both teams allowed me to relay requirements easily 
between the two and helped alleviate any blockers as they appeared.

Having exceeded our professors' expectations, they recommended that we present our game and corresponding paper on the 
gamification of learning and the 
[octalysis framework](https://yukaichou.com/gamification-examples/octalysis-complete-gamification-framework/) at the 
[Mid-Hudson Regional Business Plan Competition](https://www.marist.edu/computer-science-math/mid-hudson-regional-business-plan-competition) 
and later the [14th Annual ECC Conference](https://ecc.marist.edu/web/conference2022). At the ECC Conference, we won
the cybersecurity award for best in its category, competing against other established cybersecurity individuals and 
teams. Afterward, we licensed ARI to be used in a high school cybersecurity summer class where students were able to 
play our game and talk to us about it and cybersecurity as a whole.

You can [watch our trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_8eWLMA32Y) or

rhinOS is a browser-based operating system that is written in TypeScript, developed in an operating systems course 
during my senior year of college. The project was a culmination of all the course material into one, runnable operating 
system. rhinOS can still be run ([here](https://jlmcdonough.github.io/Operating-Systems/)).

rhinOS allows the user to load 6502a machine language opcodes into memory, execute one or more programs continuously, 
and to create, read, write, delete, execute, copy, rename, and list text files. The application supports a light and 
dark mode too. A test directory was supplied to provide examples to test the functionality of the operating system. 
rhinOS has a 100% pass rate.


## üì∑ Outside Interests

Spend most of my other time with soccer or motorsports. Both participating and watching! Can check out some of my photos from some races I've been to on 500px @[jmcdonough](https://500px.com/p/jmcdonough?view=galleries)

Have been working on more photography stuff too, and I am trying to improve. Been able to shoot some events for family and friends recently.

Also playing video games like Counter-Strike where I recorded every game I played over the course of 3 years to make a fun little report that can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jlmcdonough/jlmcdonough.github.io/blob/66133ea826507b1b0db44278b26cb97abf9351e6/files/csgoStats.pdf)
