## üöÄ About Me

My name is Joseph McDonough, and I'm a software engineer who is also CompTIA Security+ certified. Most of my
professional experience is developing backend services in Java as well as Python for scripting and jobs. I have a
passion for data and enjoy the process of receiving data and transforming it into something meaningful. And while it may
not always be worth it, I do enjoy automation. Spending hours to save a couple seconds and clicks is very rewarding to me.
Designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines that then require minimal effort and automated test suites with alerting
were some of my favorite professional projects.

Currently looking for new job opportunities to grow as a person and a professional. While my experience lies in backend,
I have a desire to learn more and expand my horizons, making me open to just about anything.

## üì∑ Outside Interests

Spend most of my other time with soccer or motorsports. Both participating and watching! Can check out some of my photos from some races I've been to on 500px @[jmcdonough](https://500px.com/p/jmcdonough?view=galleries)

Have been working on more photography stuff too, and I am trying to improve. Been able to shoot some events for family and friends recently.

Also playing video games like Counter-Strike where I recorded every game I played over the course of 3 years to make a fun little report that can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jlmcdonough/jlmcdonough.github.io/blob/66133ea826507b1b0db44278b26cb97abf9351e6/files/csgoStats.pdf)
